    <h1>Darius' Freshman Class</h1>

    <div id="description_container">
        <p>I'm Darius Daughtry, a 16-year-old music connoisseur. Hip hop is my favorite genre of music and I'm a big fan of the XXL Freshman Class that gets published annually. I love the idea of giving lesser known artists a platform for exposure to new fans. My Freshman class is very similar, almost identical in concept to XXL's, but there are a few key differences.
        </p>

        <p>
            For starters, I'm the only one who has influence in who makes the list, hence MY name being in the title. That being said, if YOUR favorite artist isn't on the list, you can't say I'm wrong because it is MY opinion. Also, the level of popularity of these artists is lower than that of artists XXL would pick. None of these artists (except for Luh Kel) have gold or platinum plaques and none of them have more than 3 million spotify monthly listeners as of July 29, 2021. Therefore, if you feel out of touch because you don't know anybody on this list, don't worry. The whole reason of this is for me to familiarize you with these criminally underrated MC's and hopefully gain them a few more fans.
        </p>

        <p>With that being said, I present to you the members of Darius' Inaugural 2021 Freshman Class (from left to right, top to bottom), Curly J, DC The Don, Lil Xxel, Luh Kel, Melii, Scorey, TheKidSzn, YNW BSlime, Young Devyn, and YSN Flow!</p>
